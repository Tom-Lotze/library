# Library for books and films
Website for keeping track of books to read and films to see. Makes use of a sqlite database for storing the records.
You can add books by submitting a bol.com link of the book, which will automatically be scraped for the right attributes. 
Similarly, and IMDB link for films and series suffices for adding those. 

The records can be put on on different lists (to read, read), and can be rated, favorited and given a review. Some statistics about the books will be shown (number of books / pages read in total and this year, minutes of film watched etc). A screenshot of the books section of the website is provided below.
